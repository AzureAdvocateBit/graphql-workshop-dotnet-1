# ☁️ Serverless Functions

Serverless is about writing functions in the Cloud that are fully managed. Fully managed means all we focus on is code. There's no OS, app server or anything else we need to care about, just code. This is called FaaS, functions as a service.

There are two important concepts we need to know about to learn about Azure Functions:

- **Trigger**, this is what starts the function, there are many things that can start a function like a HTTP request, a Queue message, a new database entry and so on
- **Bindings**, bindings come in two different flavors input bindings and output bindings. The idea is to set up a connection to a data source with you not having to type any code to do so. Instead a JSON file is used to point things like connection string and exactly what data you want. 
  - **Input binding**, an *input* binding means that we are reading data from a data source
  - **Output binding**, this means we are writing data to a data source

## Prerequisites

To start working with Azure Functions we need the following

- **azure functions core tools**, this is the core library
- **vs code extension** (optional), this will however make authoring and deploying a whole lot easiser

### Azure Functions Core Tools

Installing this looks a bit different on Linux, Mac and Windows.

**Mac**

```
brew tap azure/functions 
brew install azure-functions-core-tools
```

**Windows**

```
npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools --unsafe-perm true
```

**Ubuntu**

```
wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/19.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
```

### VS Code Extension

Install by going to this [link](vscode:extension/ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions
) or open up VS Code and type `Azure Functions`

## What we will build

We will do the following:

- **Create** an Azure Function
- **Integrate** our GraphQL API
- **Add** external endpoints to our GraphQL API

### Create an Azure Function

We will use the fact that we have installed the Azure Function VS Code extension. It comes with some valuable commands that will help us scaffold the function we need.

**Scaffold an Azure Function App + Function**

An Azure Function needs to be hosted in an Azure Function App. To create an open up the Command Palette in VS Code (CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + P) or View/Command Palette. Thereafter type `Azure Functions: Create New Project` and select that.

**First**, you will be prompted to what folder contains your project. The normal choice is the folder you are standing in.

**Secondly**, you are asked for what programming language you want the project to be, select `C#`

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1%2Ao0DqKyhGpjPYG6Owd_hAQQ.png)

**Thirdly**, you are asked for what template to use for your first function in your Azure Functions project. Select `HttpTrigger`

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1%2AtOj9evR2VzUHN3769auafg.png)

**Fourth**, now it's asking what to name our function, we name it `GraphQL`, but you can name whatever you want

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1%2AByRKpClyIg18VocVthLlIw.png)

**Fifth**, lastly it's asking you for authhorization level, essentially what credentials you need to pass to be able to call it. Select *anonymous*

Now, we should have project overview looking something like this:

```
.vscode/
.funcignore
host.json
local.settings.json -- this contains app settings keys
GraphQL.cs
```

### Integrate GraphQL

So how do we go about integrating GraphQL?

We need to do the following:
- **Move** in the GraphQL files into our Azure project
- **Remove** the part where Apollo hosts the web server
- **Update Azure Function** with call to GraphQL
- **Add** the needed libraries, i.e `GraphQL`

**Move files**

We simply move in our files into this structure, like so.

```
.vscode/
API/
  Data.cs
  Mutation.cs
  Query.cs
  Schema.cs
.funcignore
host.json
local.settings.json 
```

Let's highlight our addition:

```
API/
  Data.cs
  Mutation.cs
  Query.cs
  Schema.cs
```

**Update Azure Function**

Let's have a look at our Azure function:

```csharp
// GraphQL.cs

using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace Microsoft
{
    public static class GraphQL
    {
        [FunctionName("GraphQL")]
        public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
            [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
            ILogger log)
        {
            log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

            string name = req.Query["name"];

            string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
            dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);
            name = name ?? data?.name;

            string responseMessage = string.IsNullOrEmpty(name)
                ? "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response."
                : $"Hello, {name}. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.";

            return new OkObjectResult(responseMessage);
        }
    }
}

```

Let's update it to start using GraphQL. What we want to achieve is the following:

- **read** query parameter `query`
- **use** value of `query` to query our GraphQL server
- **respond** with data from GraphQL Server

Given the above agenda, let's change `GraphQL.cs` to the following:

```csharp
// GraphQL.cs

using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using GraphQL;

namespace Microsoft
{
    public static class GraphQL
    {
        [FunctionName("GraphQL")]
        public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
            [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
            ILogger log)
        {
            log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

            string query = req.Query["query"];
            var schema = SchemaFactory.Create();

            var json = schema.Execute(_ =>
            {
                _.Query = query;
            });
            return new OkObjectResult(json);
        }
    }
}

```

**Install GraphQL NuGet**

We need to update our project to use the `GraphQL` NuGet 

```
dotnet add package GraphQL
```

### Add external endpoints

We need to realize the following. We have built two micro services that we can now use, so we no longer need to use the in-memory data. To use them we need to do the following:

- Change code for `products` and `reviews` to do HTTP requests
- Create a nice `HttpHelper` class that easily lets us fetch the JSON data we need 
- Get a JSON parsing lib

**Install JSON lib**

```
dotnet add package System.Text.Json
```

**Create a HttpHelper**

Add the following to `Query.cs`

```csharp
// to the top
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Text.Json;


// somewhere in the code
public class HttpHelper 
  {
    public static async ValueTask<T> Get<T>(string url)
    {
      var options = new JsonSerializerOptions
      {
        PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true,
      };

      HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
      var streamTask = client.GetStreamAsync(url);
      var response = await System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync<T>(await streamTask, options);
      return response;
    }
  }
```

The above will allow us to easily specify a URL and a return type. We will see later how this `HttpHelper` class will pay off.

**Replace static data with HTTP requests**

Keep working on `Query.cs`, this time ensure the method `GetProducts()` looks like this:

```csharp
[GraphQLMetadata("products")]
public async Task<List<Product>> GetProducts()
{
  return  await HttpHelper.Get<List<Product>>("http://localhost:8000");
}
```
and `GetReviews()` should look like this:

```csharp
[GraphQLMetadata("reviews")]
public async Task<List<Review>> GetReviews()
{
  return await HttpHelper.Get<List<Review>>("http://localhost:8001");
}
```

lastly go into our `ReviewResolver` class and change the `Product()` method to say this:

```csharp
public async Task<Product> Product(ResolveFieldContext context, Review review)
{
  var products = await HttpHelper.Get<List<Product>>("http://localhost:8000");
  return products.SingleOrDefault(p => p.Id == review.Product);
}
```

### Try it out

Ensure you have started up the Micro services from part3 with 

```
docker-compose up
```

Ensure you they respond to `http://localhost:8000` and `http://localhost:8001` respectively.

Let's start the debugger for the Azure Function

Now type the below `URL`

```
http://localhost:7071/api/GraphQL?query={ reviews { title, grade, product { name } } }
```


This nested query should now resolve by querying both our products endpoint and our reviews endpoint.
