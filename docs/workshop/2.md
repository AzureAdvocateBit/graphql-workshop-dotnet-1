# üîé GraphQL

Let's first give a little intro to GraphQL and the different parts it consist of. 

## Concepts

- **Schema**, this is where you define your data types and what things you can query for
- **Resolvers**, these are functions that are being invoked when you ask for something from the schema. Your resolvers should respond with data or change the data depending on what they are meant for.

## Our first hello world API

The easiest way to understand GraphQL is to build something with it and learn as we go.

We will use something called `GQL` or **G**raphQL **Q**uery **L**anguage. We define our first simple schema like so:

### Schema

```
type Query {
  hello: String
}
```

At this point we have defined the built in type `Query` and we are saying there is one thing we can query for, namely `hello`. Note how we after `:` is saying `string`. This is us saying what the return type is for `hello`;

This means we can pose a query like so:

```
{
  hello
}
```

We won't get an answer at this point because we haven't connected it to a resolver function that knows how to answer. 

Now, connecting a schema to a resolver is done differently depending on what library you use to build your GraphQL server.

### Resolver

Let's define a resolver like it looks like in most implementations:

```csharp
public class Query 
{
  [GraphQLMetadata("hello")]
  public string GetHello() 
  {
      return "World";
  }
}
```

### Custom type

In GraphQL you have different primitives, also called scalar types, that can serve as inputs, return types. You can also combine several primitives to form a custom type. Lets first mention what those primitives are:

- **String**, this is your typical string type, containing string characters
- **ID**, represents a unique identifier, signifies that it is not intended to be human‚Äêreadable
- **Float**, A signed double-precision floating-point value
- **Int**. A signed 32‚Äêbit integer
- **Boolean**, has the value true or false

So far we have only the queryable property `hello` and one resolver function. You are likely to want to build something more advanced than that and combining scalars in a group we can create a custom type like so:

```
type Person {
  id: ID!
  name: String,
  address: String,
  speaker: Boolean
}
```

NOTE, we starting using exclamation character `!` on the `id` field, which means that this value cannot be *null*, i.e we can't leave it out.

We can also, as mentioned use our custom type in our schema so we can extend it to look like so:

```
type Person {
  id: ID!
  name: String,
  address: String,
  speaker: Boolean
}

type Query {
  hello: string,
  person: Person
}
```

which means we now need a new resolver function, like so:

```csharp
public class Query 
{
  [GraphQLMetadata("hello")]
  public string GetHello() 
  {
    return "World";
  }

  [GraphQLMetadata("person")]
  public Person GetPerson() 
  {
    return new Person()
    { 
      Id=1, 
      Name="Jen",
      Address ="One Microsoft Way Redmond USA",
      Speaker = True
    };
  }
}

```

### List type

List type means that we can define in the schema that we get an array of whatever item back, like so:

```
type Person {
  id: ID!
  name: String,
  address: String,
  speaker: Boolean
}

type Query {
  hello: string,
  person: Person,
  people: [Person]
}
```

We add the queryable type `people` which has the return type `[Person]` which simply means a list of the type `Person`. This of course means that we need to add a resolver function for this so we extend our resolver object with yet another function `people`:

```csharp
public class Query 
{
  [GraphQLMetadata("hello")]
  public string GetHello() 
  {
    return "World";
  }

  [GraphQLMetadata("person")]
  public Person GetPerson() 
  {
    return new Person()
    { 
      Id=1, 
      Name="Jen",
      Address ="One Microsoft Way Redmond USA",
      Speaker = True
    };
  }

  [GraphQLMetadata("people")]
  public List<Person> GetPeople() 
  {
    return new new List<Person>(){
      new Person()
      { 
        Id=1, 
        Name="Jen",
        Address ="One Microsoft Way Redmond USA",
        Speaker = True
      },
      new Person()
      { 
        Id=2, 
        Name="Chris",
        Address ="One Microsoft Way Redmond USA",
        Speaker = True
      }
    };
  }
}
```

## Query with argument

Now you of course if going to want to filter down your response at some point by being able to ask for a specific item. Imagine you don't want the full list of people back but a specific person. For that use case we can expose a queryable that takes a parameter like so:

```
type Person {
  id: ID!
  name: String,
  address: String,
  speaker: Boolean
}

type Query {
  hello: string,
  person: Person,
  people: [Person],
  getPerson(id: ID!): Person
}
```

Now, to add this to our resolver object we just need to add a matching name property `getPerson` but we also need to dig out the parameter from the incoming request object:

```csharp
var people = new List<Person>()
{
  new Person()
  { 
    Id=1, 
    Name="Jen",
    Address ="One Microsoft Way Redmond USA",
    Speaker = True
  },
  new Person()
  { 
    Id=2, 
    Name="Chris",
    Address ="One Microsoft Way Redmond USA",
    Speaker = True
  }
};

public class Query 
{
  [GraphQLMetadata("hello")]
  public string GetHello() 
  {
    return "World";
  }

  [GraphQLMetadata("person")]
  public Person GetPerson() 
  {
    return new Person()
    { 
      Id=1, 
      Name="Jen",
      Address ="One Microsoft Way Redmond USA",
      Speaker = True
    };
  }

  [GraphQLMetadata("people")]
  public List<Person> GetPeople() 
  {
    return people;
  }

  [GraphQLMetadata("getPerson")]
  public Person GetPersonById(int id) 
  {
    return people.SingleOrDefault( p => p.Id == id);
  }
}
```

## Mutation

So far we have concentrated on learning scalars, custom types and how to build out our resolver object to be able to answer all of our queries and that really is the *bread and butter* of mastering GraphQL. But there is another construct we need to know about to be able to build a CRUD, **C**reate **R**ead **U**pdate **D**elete API, namely *mutations*. A *Mutation* is something that in GraphQL signals that we want to change something, either create something new, update it or remove it. 

Let's start with a very simple Mutation, adding an item to a list:

```
type Mutation {
  addItem(item: String): String
}
```

Just like anything inside of a `Query` we can invoke anything inside it like a public API so we can call `addItem` like so:

```
addItem(item: "my new item")
```

Most of the time you might want a more complex input type than a scalar. At that we need to build such an input type, like so:

```
input ProductInput {
  id: ID!
  name: String,
  address: String,
  speaker: Boolean
}
```

As you can see it's pretty much identical to our `type Person` and NO we can't use that one, we need to define something of type `input` like above. Let's add a `addPerson` property to our Schema:

```
input PersonInput {
  id: ID!
  name: String,
  address: String,
  speaker: Boolean
}

type Person {
  id: ID!
  name: String,
  address: String,
  speaker: Boolean
}

type Mutation {
  addPerson(person: PersonInput): Person
}

type Query {
  hello: string,
  person: Person,
  people: [Person],
  getPerson(id: ID!): Person
}
```

To invoke this mutation `addPerson` we type:

```
addPerson(person: { id: 3, name: 'Amy', address: `One Microsoft Way Redmond USA`, speaker: true }) {
  name
}
```

NOTE, we do get a return type of type `Person` so we need to select one or more columns as we are inserting a person but querying the response.

lastly let's add our resolve function to our object:

```csharp
var people = new List<Person>()
{
  new Person()
  { 
    Id=1, 
    Name="Jen",
    Address ="One Microsoft Way Redmond USA",
    Speaker = True
  },
  new Person()
  { 
    Id=2, 
    Name="Chris",
    Address ="One Microsoft Way Redmond USA",
    Speaker = True
  }
};

public class Query 
{
  [GraphQLMetadata("hello")]
  public string GetHello() 
  {
    return "World";
  }

  [GraphQLMetadata("person")]
  public Person GetPerson() 
  {
    return new Person()
    { 
      Id=1, 
      Name="Jen",
      Address ="One Microsoft Way Redmond USA",
      Speaker = True
    };
  }

  [GraphQLMetadata("people")]
  public List<Person> GetPeople() 
  {
    return people;
  }

  [GraphQLMetadata("getPerson")]
  public Person GetPersonById(int id) 
  {
    return people.SingleOrDefault( p => p.Id == id);
  }
}

[GraphQLMetadata("Mutation")]
public class Mutation {
  public String addPerson(Person person) 
  {
    people.push(person);
    return "Success creating " + person;
  } 
}
```

## Nested type

Quite often we want to do queries where we query at depth and we might have a schema looking like this:

```
type Person {
  id: ID!
  name: String,
  address: String,
  speaker: Boolean,
  friend: Person
}
```

Especially note the property `friend`. There are two question we need an answer to here:

1. how do you store the data?
2. how do we resolve `friend`

Two very good questions and the answer is simple. 
As for how we store the data the answer is that our `friend` property needs to point to a primitive that represents the unique identifier, which means the data needs to look like this:

```csharp
var person = new Person()
{
  Id = 1,
  Name = "Jen",
  Address = "One Microsoft Way Redmond USA",
  Speaker = True,
  Friend = 2
};
```

NOTE how `friend` has value `2`. 

Now to the next question, how to resolve this? What we mean by resolve is how to we support queries like this:

```
{
  person {
    id,
    name,
    address,
    friend {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

As we said this is pretty simple once you know how. Let's go to our resolver object and update it like so:

```csharp
var people = new List<Person>()
{
  new Person()
  { 
    Id=1, 
    Name="Jen",
    Address ="One Microsoft Way Redmond USA",
    Speaker = True,
    Friend = 2
  },
  new Person()
  { 
    Id=2, 
    Name="Chris",
    Address ="One Microsoft Way Redmond USA",
    Speaker = True,
    Friend = 1
  }
};

public class Query 
{
  [GraphQLMetadata("hello")]
  public string GetHello() 
  {
    return "World";
  }

  [GraphQLMetadata("person")]
  public Person GetPerson() 
  {
    return new Person()
    { 
      Id=1, 
      Name="Jen",
      Address ="One Microsoft Way Redmond USA",
      Speaker = True
    };
  }

  [GraphQLMetadata("people")]
  public List<Person> GetPeople() 
  {
    return people;
  }

  [GraphQLMetadata("getPerson")]
  public Person GetPersonById(int id) 
  {
    return people.SingleOrDefault( p => p.Id == id);
  }
}

[GraphQLMetadata("Mutation")]
public class Mutation {
  public String addPerson(Person person) 
  {
    people.push(person);
    return "Success creating " + person;
  } 
}

// this is used to resolve `friend`
[GraphQLMetadata("Person", IsTypeOf=typeof(Person))]
public class PersonResolver 
{
  public Person Friend(ResolveFieldContext context, Person source)
  {
    return people.SingleOrDefault(p => p.Id == source.Friend);
  }
}
```

NOTE, the addition of `Person` and its inner property `friend` that points to a resolver function that gets passed the value `2` which it is able to resolve by filtering that out of the list `people`.


## What we will build

We will build a GraphQL consisting of two different resources `Products` and `Reviews`. The idea is two:

1. Demonstrate how to build a GraphQL API
2. Learn how to build your API to support nested queries

### Part I - Install and set up

We assume you have installed .NET Core already. If you haven't go to the [install page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/sdk?pivots=os-windows)

**Create a directory**
Next step is to create a directory and place yourself in it:

```
mkdir api
cd api
```

Thereafter we need to create a Node.js project. The easiest way is by running this command:

**Initialize a .NET Core project**

```
dotnet new console -o api
```

This will create a `console` project. You can definitely create a web project if you want to support things such `graphiql`, a visual environment to try out your queries.

**Install dependencies**
Now you are ready for the next step which is to install GraphQL. We will do that by the following command:

```
dotnet add package GraphQL
```

> Currently I've set my .NET Core app to 2.2

**Create our Server**

We will do the following:

- Define schema
- Define a Query Class
- Execute a Query

Open up `Program.cs` and add the following at the top of the file:

```
using GraphQL;
using GraphQL.Types;
```

in the `Main()` method:

```csharp
var schema = Schema.For(@"
  type Query {
      hello: String
  }
  ", _ =>
  {
  _.Types.Include<Query>();
  });
```

Next add the `Query` class in the `Program.cs` file, like so:

```csharp
using GraphQL;

public class Query
{
  [GraphQLMetadata("hello")]
  public string GetHello()
  {
  return "World";
  }
}
```

Now to run a query we need the following code, still in `Main()` method:

```csharp
var json = schema.Execute(_ =>
{
    _.Query = "{ hello }";
});

Console.WriteLine(json);
```

Next up, we want to run this. We do so by typing the following in the terminal:

```
dotnet run
```

You should now see something like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "hello": "World"
  }
}
```

### Part II - custom types

In this next part we will take our existing app and give it some more types, namely `products`. We will show how to:

- **query** for all products
- **query** for a specific product
- **create** a new product

Lets begin. 

**Refactoring**

The first thing we will do is to separate our `Program.cs` into several files:

- **Program.cs** this will only be used to run queries on our schema
- **Schema.cs**, this will contain our schema definition
- **Query.cs** this will contain our resolver object

The content of these files should now be:

```csharp
// Query.cs

using GraphQL.Types;
using GraphQL;

namespace app 
{
  public class Query
  {
    [GraphQLMetadata("hello")]
    public string GetHello()
    {
      return "World";
    }
  }
}
```

```csharp
// Schema.cs

using GraphQL.Types;
using GraphQL;

namespace app 
{
  public class SchemaFactory 
  {
    public static ISchema Create() 
    {
      var schema = Schema.For(@"
          type Query {
              hello: String
          }
      ", _ =>
      {
        _.Types.Include<Query>();
      });
      return schema;
    }
  }
}
```

```csharp
// Program.cs

using System;
using GraphQL;
using GraphQL.Types;

namespace app
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var schema = SchemaFactory.Create();
            var json = schema.Execute(_ =>
            {
                _.Query = "{ hello }";
            });

            Console.WriteLine(json);
        }
    }
}
```

**Adding a custom type and some new queries**

Ok, now that we added a custom type, lets open up `Schema.cs` and add the custom type `Product`:

```csharp
// Schema.cs

using GraphQL.Types;
using GraphQL;

namespace app
{
  public class SchemaFactory
  {
    public static ISchema Create()
    {
      var schema = Schema.For(@"
          type Product {
            id: ID,
            name: String
          }

          type Query {
            hello: String,
            products: [Product],
            product(id: ID!): Product
          }
      ", _ =>
      {
        _.Types.Include<Query>();
      });
      return schema;
    }
  }
}
```

Above we have added the custom type `Product`, by doing this:

```
type Product {
  id: ID,
  name: String
}
```

Then we have added the following to type `Schema.cs`:

```
products: [Product],
product(id: ID!): Product
```

The first row means we can query for `products` and expect to get a product array back, as indicated by the array `[]` symbol.

The second `product(id: ID!)`, means we added a query that made it possible to query for `product` but it needs a parameter `id`. 

Below is how you would invoke them: 

```
{
  products {
    name
  }
  product(id: 1) { 
    name 
  }
}
```

**Adding resolvers**

We need to add resolver methods to be able to respond if the user types either `products` or `product`. For this we will open up `Query.cs` and ensure it looks like this:

```csharp
// Query.cs

using GraphQL.Types;
using GraphQL;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace app
{
  public class Product 
  {
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
  }
  public class Query
  {
    public static List<Product> Products = new List<Product>()
    {
      new Product()
      {
        Id = 1,
        Name = "Avengers - End Game"
      }
    };

    [GraphQLMetadata("hello")]
    public string GetHello()
    {
      return "World";
    }

    [GraphQLMetadata("products")]
    public List<Product> GetProducts()
    {
      return Data.Products;
    }

    [GraphQLMetadata("product")]
    public Product GetProductById(int id)
    {
      return Data.Products.SingleOrDefault( p => p.Id == id );
    }
  }
} 
```

Above we add the methods `GetProducts()` and `GetProductById()` respectively. 

NOTE, to get input parameters we need to just specify those as an input params where they are used as with the method `GetProductById()`

Secondly we will add the file `Data.cs`, a static data repository, that will contain all the data we want to query for and change. 

```csharp
// Data.cs
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace app 
{
  public class Data 
  {
    public static List<Product> Products = new List<Product>()
    {
      new Product()
      {
        Id = 1,
        Name = "Avengers - End Game"
      }
    };
  }
}
```

Lastly change `Program.cs` to look like this:

```csharp
using System;
using GraphQL;
using GraphQL.Types;

namespace app
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      var schema = SchemaFactory.Create();
      var json = schema.Execute(_ =>
      {
        _.Query = "{ products { name } product(id: 1){ name  } }";
      });

      Console.WriteLine(json);
    }
  }
}
```

Followed by `dotnet run`, that should give the following output in the terminal:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "products": [
      {
        "name": "Avengers - End Game"
      }
    ],
    "product": {
      "name": "Avengers - End Game"
    }
  }
}
```

**Supporting 'create product' - adding mutations**

Now we know how to support queries, lets look into supporting scenarios in which we add data. We will support creating a product. They way we do that is by adding a mutation. Lets start with updating the schema file `Schema.cs`:

```csharp
using GraphQL.Types;
using GraphQL;

namespace app
{
  public class SchemaFactory
  {
    public static ISchema Create()
    {
      var schema = Schema.For(@"
          type Product {
            id: ID,
            name: String
          }

          input ProductInput {
            name: String
          }

          type Mutation {
            createProduct(product: ProductInput): Product
          }

          type Query {
            hello: String,
            products: [Product],
            product(id: ID!): Product
          }
      ", _ =>
      {
        _.Types.Include<Query>();
        _.Types.Include<Mutation>();
      });
      return schema;
    }
  }
}
```

Above we added the type `Mutation` and in there we have added the `createProduct`, that takes a parameter `product` of type `ProductInput`. We can also see that we need to return something of type `Product`. `ProductInput` is of type `input` and is something we only use with mutations.  We've also added this row ` _.Types.Include<Mutation>();` to support our `Mutation` class that we are about to create next.


Ok, we got the contract explained to us, let's create the file `Mutation.cs` and give it the following content:

```csharp
// Mutation

using GraphQL.Types;
using GraphQL;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace app
{
  public class Mutation
  {
    [GraphQLMetadata("createProduct")]
    public Product CreateProduct(Product product)
    {
      product.Id = Data.Products.Count() + 1;
      Data.Products.Add(product);
      return product;
    }
  }
}
```

Above we have added the method `CreateProduct()`. We have also added the `Mutation` property of our object that we end up exporting. 

To test this mutation, change `Program.cs` to the following:

```csharp
using System;
using GraphQL;
using GraphQL.Types;

namespace app
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      var schema = SchemaFactory.Create();
      var json = schema.Execute(_ =>
      {
        _.Query = "mutation { createProduct(product: { name: \"Captain America - the first Avenger\" }) { name }  }";
      });

      Console.WriteLine(json);
    }
  }
}
```

NOTE, how our query now says the following:

```csharp
_.Query = "mutation { createProduct(product: { name: \"Captain America - the first Avenger\" }) { name }  }"
```

Above we use the keyword `mutation`. They keyword `mutation` optionally takes an argument if you want to have named mutation. If you want many of the them you need to name them. That's beyond the scope of this workshop.

### Part II - Adding reviews, supporting nested queries

Now we will extend our schema with the custom type `Review` and also support nested queries. 

To accomplish this we need to do the following:

1. Add a custom type definition to `Review` to `Schema.cs`
2. Add in memory data for reviews in `Data.cs`
3. Add resolver function to `Query.cs`
4. Try it out 

**Add custom type definition**

The definition of `Review` should look like this:

```
type Review {
  grade: Int,
  title: String,
  description: String,
  product: Product
}
```

our `Schema.cs` should now look like this:

```csharp
using GraphQL.Types;
using GraphQL;

namespace app
{
  public class SchemaFactory
  {
    public static ISchema Create()
    {
      var schema = Schema.For(@"
          type Product {
            id: ID,
            name: String
          }

          type Review {
            grade: Int,
            title: String,
            description: String,
            product: Product
          }

          input ProductInput {
            name: String
          }

          type Mutation {
            createProduct(product: ProductInput): Product
          }

          type Query {
            hello: String,
            products: [Product],
            product(id: ID!): Product,
            reviews: [Review]
          }
      ", _ =>
      {
        _.Types.Include<Query>();
        _.Types.Include<Mutation>();
      });
      return schema;
    }
  }
}
```

**Add in memory data**

Ensure `Data.cs` now looks like this:

```csharp
// Data.cs

using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace app 
{

  public class Product
  {
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
  }

  public class Review
  {
    public int Grade { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public int Product { get; set; }
  }
  public class Data 
  {
    public static List<Product> Products = new List<Product>()
    {
      new Product()
      {
        Id = 1,
        Name = "Avengers - End Game"
      }
    };

    public static List<Review> Reviews = new List<Review>()
    {
      new Review()
      {
        Grade = 5,
        Title = "Great movie",
        Description = "Great actor playing Thanos",
        Product = 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

NOTE, we moved `Product` class into `Data.cs` and removed it from `Query.cs`. 

Let's now add a method `GetReviews()` to our `Query.cs` class like so:

```csharp

```

It's also nice to add a method that we can call in our resolver, like so:

```csharp
[GraphQLMetadata("reviews")]
public Product GetReviews()
{
  return Data.Reviews;
}
```

`Query.cs` should look like this, at this point:

```csharp
using GraphQL.Types;
using GraphQL;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace app
{
  public class Query
  {
    [GraphQLMetadata("hello")]
    public string GetHello()
    {
      return "World";
    }

    [GraphQLMetadata("products")]
    public List<Product> GetProducts()
    {
      return Data.Products;
    }

    [GraphQLMetadata("product")]
    public Product GetProductById(int id)
    {
      return Data.Products.SingleOrDefault( p => p.Id == id );
    }

    [GraphQLMetadata("reviews")]
    public Product GetReviews()
    {
      return Data.Reviews;
    }
  }
} 
```

**Add nested resolver function**

We are about to support a query like this:

```
{
  reviews {
    product { name }
  }
}
```

For that to be possible we need a function with the capability to turn an integer into a `Product` object. Why am I saying that? Look at the review data one more time:

```csharp
new Review()
{
  Grade = 5,
  Title = "Great movie",
  Description = "Great actor playing Thanos",
  Product = 1
}
```

The `Product` field is pointing to `1` not a `Product` object. How to fix? Well, GraphQL will try to resolve this for us providing we give it a provider of Type `Review` that is a able to solve our `Product` field. The Provider should look something like this:

```csharp
[GraphQLMetadata("Review", IsTypeOf = typeof(Review))]
public class ReviewResolver
{
  public string Title(Review review) => review.Title;
  public string Description(Review review) => review.Description;
  public int Grade(Review review) => review.Grade;
  public Product Product(ResolveFieldContext context, Review review)
  {
    return Data.Products.SingleOrDefault(p => p.Id == review.Product);
  }
}
```

What we are saying above is that simple fields simply are resolved like this:

```csharp
public string Title(Review review) => review.Title;
```

whereas fields that are integers, that we know point to real objects, according to our schema, will be resolved by methods instead like the `Product()` method that actively looks up our `1` and turns it into a `Product`.

Our `Query.cs` should now look like this:

```csharp
using GraphQL.Types;
using GraphQL;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace app
{
  public class Query
  {
    [GraphQLMetadata("hello")]
    public string GetHello()
    {
      return "World";
    }

    [GraphQLMetadata("products")]
    public List<Product> GetProducts()
    {
      return Data.Products;
    }

    [GraphQLMetadata("product")]
    public Product GetProductById(int id)
    {
      return Data.Products.SingleOrDefault( p => p.Id == id );
    }

    [GraphQLMetadata("reviews")]
    public List<Review> GetReviews()
    {
      return Data.Reviews;
    }
  }

  [GraphQLMetadata("Review", IsTypeOf = typeof(Review))]
  public class ReviewResolver
  {
    public string Title(Review review) => review.Title;
    public string Description(Review review) => review.Description;
    public int Grade(Review review) => review.Grade;
    public Product Product(ResolveFieldContext context, Review review)
    {
      return Data.Products.SingleOrDefault(p => p.Id == review.Product);
    }
  }
} 
```

Don't forget to add this line `_.Types.Include<ReviewResolver>();` to `Schema.cs` so that file now looks like this: 

```csharp
// Schema.cs

using GraphQL.Types;
using GraphQL;

namespace app
{
  public class SchemaFactory
  {
    public static ISchema Create()
    {
      var schema = Schema.For(@"
          type Product {
            id: ID,
            name: String
          }

          type Review {
            grade: Int,
            title: String,
            description: String,
            product: Product
          }

          input ProductInput {
            name: String
          }

          type Mutation {
            createProduct(product: ProductInput): Product
          }

          type Query {
            hello: String,
            products: [Product],
            product(id: ID!): Product,
            reviews: [Review]
          }
      ", _ =>
      {
        _.Types.Include<Query>();
        _.Types.Include<Mutation>();
        _.Types.Include<ReviewResolver>();
      });
      return schema;
    }
  }
}
```

Finally let's try this out by altering `Program.cs` to:

```csharp
// Program.cs

using System;
using GraphQL;
using GraphQL.Types;

namespace app
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      var schema = SchemaFactory.Create();
      var json = schema.Execute(_ =>
      {
        _.Query = "{ reviews { product { name } } }";
      });

      Console.WriteLine(json);
    }
  }
}
```

NOTE, how this line `_.Query= "{ reviews { product { name } } }"` queries in a nested way and forces our code to resolve our `product` property. Executing this with `dotnet run` should give you the following output:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "reviews": [
      {
        "product": {
          "name": "Avengers - End Game"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
